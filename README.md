# Deploying and Sharing a Dockerized React Application

This repository provides a **step-by-step guide** to deploy, Dockerize, and share a React application using Docker and Nginx on an Ubuntu VM. Additionally, it covers **Docker networking**, allowing students to understand how containers communicate in different environments.

Each section is covered in a separate file for structured learning.

### **5. Docker Networking**
**Understanding how containers communicate** is crucial for building scalable applications. This section explores different networking modes in Docker and how they impact container communication.

#### **Topics Covered:**
1. **Scenario 1: Running a Standalone Application**
   - Deploying a single container
   - Mapping ports for external access

2. **Scenario 2: Two Containers Communicating (Microservices)**
   - Using a custom **bridge network** for inter-container communication
   - Connecting a frontend container to a backend API

3. **Scenario 3: Multi-Tier Architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database)**
   - Creating isolated networks for better **security and performance**
   - Connecting a **backend service** to a **database container**
   - Allowing frontend-to-backend communication without direct database exposure

4. **Scenario 4: Using Host Mode for High-Performance Applications**
   - Running a container in **host mode** for low-latency applications
   - Understanding the impact of **NAT elimination** and **direct network access**
